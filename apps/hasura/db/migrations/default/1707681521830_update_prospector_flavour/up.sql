UPDATE background
SET description = 'Prospector empires specialize in extracting and processing natural resources, utilizing a network of mining and refining facilities across planets and orbital stations. These empires engage in complex trade dynamics, as various factions compete for access to lucrative resource deposits. These factions may align based on corporate interests, national affiliations, or the ever-shifting economic and political landscape within the empire. <br/> <br/> While prospector empires contribute significantly to economic growth, their intensive resource extraction poses a considerable threat to interstellar stability. The environmental toll of their activities raises concerns about irreversible damage and ecological collapse on the planets they operate on. Striking a balance between economic prosperity and environmental responsibility becomes a pivotal challenge for these empires as they navigate the delicate interplay between resource exploitation and the preservation of planetary ecosystems.'
