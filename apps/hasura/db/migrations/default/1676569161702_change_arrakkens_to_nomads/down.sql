They have made it their home, using their expertise in trade and commerce to survive and thrive in the harsh conditions. Aridus serves as a hub for trade and commerce in a federation of planets, with the Nomads acting as the overseers of trade between the different worlds. They have a deep understanding of the markets and economies of the various planets, and use this knowledge to broker deals and negotiate contracts. The Nomads are a proud and independent people, fiercely protective of their freedom and their way of life. They are experts in survival, able to eke out a living in the harsh desert conditions, and they are skilled in the arts of negotiation and bargaining.'
